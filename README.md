# Sight-Word-Tracker

Sight words are commonly used in special education as a method of teaching students to read and recognize frequently used words. In special education, sight words are often introduced in the early stages of reading instruction to help students build a strong foundation for reading success.

By mastering sight words, students are able to recognize common words quickly and easily, allowing them to focus on more challenging words and comprehension. This can be especially important for students with learning disabilities or those who struggle with phonics-based reading instruction.

Overall, sight words play a critical role in special education by helping students develop important reading skills and achieve success in their academic pursuits.

Education Specialists often make reading goals that include sight words for each student's IEP (Individualized Education Plans). They create accuracy goals for the student to ideally reach by the end of each quarter/year.

My goal is to build an interactive sight word data tracker for educators to use when they are evaluating student progress on IEP each quarter. 
It will have sight words available and also data taking functionality to allow analysis of student progress.

This project is still a work in progress!
